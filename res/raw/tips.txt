THIS IS WHERE I found something precious... we made youthful indiscretions... the smell reminds me of... my scar came from... a stranger stopped me to say... we were let down and heartbroken after... we decided to live... I jumped into the car and went all the way to... the strangest thing happened... someone did something unusually kind... my heros come out to play... I would rather be... I am the furthest from home... my mind wanders whenever we look around and see...
